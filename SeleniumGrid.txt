SeleniumGrid & SauceLabs

Selenium Grid:

When the test suite is larger (more no of testcases) and we have to
execeute tests in multiple browsers and OperatingSystems.

We need to save time by running tests in parallel.

It will allow to run scripts on different machines and different browsers at same time.
Chrome in mac
firefix in mac
chrome in windows
firefox in linux


It consists of one hub and multiple nodes.
Hub is a central point that controls all the nodes.
NOdes are actual machines where execution occurs.

SeleniumGrid:
We can automate uotp 5 browsers

Hub:

Central point where we load tests
We wil have one hub in grid which is launched in single machine


Download seleniun server jar on hub and also node machines


Go to location where u have jar using cmd prompt and execute this cmd to start hub: 
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar -role hub
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar -role hub -port 4446

Go to other achine which you want to use as node , download jar, and Go to location where u have jar using cmd prompt and execute this cmd to start node:
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar -role node -hub http://192.168.15.2:4444/grid/register
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar -role node -hub http://192.168.15.2:4444/grid/register -port 5556

cmd to start node along with browser excutable system property:
java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=C:\Users\WBL\MedhaMayWorkspace\MayAutomationFramework\resources\drivers\chromedriver.exe  -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar -role node -hub http://192.168.15.2:4444/grid/register -port 5556

write the script using eclipse
In order to use selenium grid- we mainly use 2 classes- DesiredCapabilties(platform/OS, browser, versions)
and RemoteWebDriver 


Cloud Platform: 
BrowserStack and SauceLabs:
IAAS- infrastructure as a service
