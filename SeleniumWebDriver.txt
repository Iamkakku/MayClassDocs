PageObject pattern:
Every page in UI application will have a corresponding Java Page Class and Test Class.
Main advantage of PageObject pattern is clear separation of testcases which helps for easy maintenance.
Also it avoids code redundancy.

Page classes - have the logic to identify the WebElement and return back the actual value/elements needed for assertions.
TestClasses -  assertions 


HomePage- test navigations manu, header links, search box,click signin, register....
SearchResultsPage- test the no of results, valid reslts, sort features(by rating, price), filters...
SearchDetailsPage-
AddToCartPage


HomePageTest
SearchResultsPageTest
SearchDetailsPageTest
AddToCartPageTest

3 packages:
com.wbl.page
com.wbl.base
com.wbl.test

created 3 page classes, 3 test classes, 1 BaseTest Class
PAgeclasses- lgoic to identify elements , page classes need driver- which we injected by using construtcor
TestClasses - we have to call page class methods and add assertions once we get actual,to call page classes we should pass driver object
which we inherit from BaseTest
BaseTest- we created driver using BeforeClass annotation

Thread.sleep(3000);// by default pause program execution

element is loaded immediately
its taking time to load the element 


Waits:

ImplicitWait: implicit wait waits for any of the element that takes time to load in webpage/poll the DOM.
default is 0 seconds.

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlWait(20, TimeUnit.SEONDS);

It wil initially check if the element is present , if its found then it will not wait for given wait time 20secoonds
if it is not found 0 then it waits for complete wait time(eg:20seconds) even though element is avaialble within 10 or 15 seconds.

Meaning which it checks first at 0th sec and after 20 seconds- not in between


ExplicitWait:
It waits for a specific element or condition
		
		WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,30);
		element =wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector(".prime-button-try>a")));
		element.click();
		
It wil initially check if the element is present , if its found then it will not wait for given wait time(20secoonds)

if it is not found at 0th sec then it starts waiting for given waittime
but it keeps checking in between by default for every 500ms if element is found- if it is found then it will not wait for entire time
20seconds
0th
500ms
.....
10th sec or 15th sec - 

Fluent Wait: 
is s type of explicit wait where we have option o override the polling/frequency time
and we have other option like ignoringException...

both explicit wait and fluent wait have method - wait.until- which accepts
ExpectedConditions, Function and Predicate.
Predicate(I) has apply method where output is always boolean and any input type
but in function(I) you can have your own output and input types in method.
